			<p>
		The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 1997. The short form "blog" was later coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase "we blog."  Blogging started as a way for individuals to share their thoughts, ideas, and daily experiences. Early examples were similar to digital diaries with text and images. It rapidly grew in popularity and evolved into a powerful medium for communication, influencing journalism, politics, and marketing.
